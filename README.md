Brief

You have been hired to build a front-end user interface for an existing API blogging application. The client has asked for a responsive application that allows users to view dynamic blog posts. The client requires admin pages to register, login and manage their blog posts. During testing, you will use your own account that you create to act as the owner.

· Sector: Tech Research and Development

· Size: 30 employees

· Location: Worldwide

· Mission: Provide the most accurate and up to date insights to tech leaders across the world.

Blog Feed Page

The blog feed page requires the following user stories:

¨ As a user, I want to see an interactive banner carousel on the blog feed page, so that I can view a rotation of the 3 latest posts.

¨ As a user, I want to click on a button for each carousel item, taking me to the blog post page to read more.

¨ As a user, I want to click on the previous or next button in the carousel to animate and reveal another post, to ensure I can see different posts easily.

¨ As a user, I want the carousel to return to the first post after reaching the end of the list, and vice versa when clicking previous on the first post.

¨ As a user, I want to view a static list of the 12 latest posts in a responsive thumbnail grid on the blog feed page, so I can easily select which post to read.

¨ As a user, I want each thumbnail in the blog post feed to be clickable, taking me to the blog post page to read more.

Blog Post Public Page

The blog post public page requires the following user stories:

¨ As a user, I want to see a responsive layout showing the post title, author, publication date, image banner, and post content from the API.

¨ As a user, I want each blog page to have a shareable URL including a query string or hash parameter that contains the post ID, so I can share the post with others easily.

Blog Post Edit Page

The blog post edit page requires the following user stories:

¨ As the owner, I want the blog post edit page to be available only for me when logged in, to ensure no unauthorized edits can be made to my posts.

¨ As the owner, I want a delete button that sends a DELETE request to the API for this post ID on the edit page, so I can easily remove my post if needed.

¨ As the owner, I want a validated edit form that allows me to update the title, body content, or image by sending a POST request to the API for this post ID, ensuring I can keep my posts up to date easily.

Account Login Page

¨ As the owner, I want a validated login form that allows me to request and save a token to my browser by entering my email and password, allowing me to manage posts.

Account Register Page

¨ As the owner, I want a validated register form that allows me to create a new account by entering my name, email and password.
